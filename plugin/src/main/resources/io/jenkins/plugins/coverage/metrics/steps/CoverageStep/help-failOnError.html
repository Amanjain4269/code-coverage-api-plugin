<div>
    This toggle determines if the coverage plugin should fail the build whenever an error occurred during processing
    of the coverage results. Several errors might occur: file pattern matches no files, source files
    could not be copied, etc. By default, these errors are logged in a separate view but the build status will
    not be altered. If you would rather like to fail the build on such errors, please tick this checkbox.
