    Select the baseline to be used for the code coverage computation of this quality gate.

    The following different baselines are supported:

    <dl>
        <dt>PROJECT</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the whole project. This is an absolute value that might not change much from build to build.
        </dd>
        <dt>PROJECT_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the project coverages of the current build and the reference build. Teams can use this delta
            value to ensure that the coverage will not decrease.
        </dd>
        <dt>CHANGE</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the changed lines (e.g., within the changed lines of a pull or merge request)
            will focus on new or changed code only.
        </dd>
        <dt>CHANGE_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the project coverage and the change coverage of the current build. Teams can use this delta
            value to ensure that the coverage of pull requests is better than the whole project coverage.
        </dd>
        <dt>FILE</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the changed files (e.g., within the files that have been touched in a pull or merge request)
            will focus on new or changed code only.
        </dd>
        <dt>FILE_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the project coverage and the file coverage of the current build. Teams can use this delta
            value to ensure that the coverage of pull requests is better than the whole project coverage.
        </dd>
    </dl>
