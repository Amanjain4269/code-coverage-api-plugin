    Select the baseline for the coverage results that are shown in this column.

    The following different baselines are supported:

    <dl>
        <dt>PROJECT</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the whole project. This is an absolute value that might not change much from build to build.
        </dd>
        <dt>PROJECT_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the project coverages of the current build and the reference build.
        </dd>
        <dt>CHANGE</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the changed lines (e.g., within the changed lines of a pull or merge request)
            will focus on new or changed code only.
        </dd>
        <dt>CHANGE_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the project coverage and the change coverage of the current build.
        </dd>
        <dt>FILE</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the changed files (e.g., within the files that have been touched in a pull or merge request)
            will focus on new or changed code only.
        </dd>
        <dt>FILE_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the project coverage and the file coverage of the current build.
        </dd>
    </dl>
